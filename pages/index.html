                Welcome to the EL/R (Section B - Research). Through a series of
                up to three courses (CSE 302/303/402), you may select and
                contribute to a research project from a wide range of topics
                and areas and work closely with one of our faculty members who
                is an expert in those areas as your project mentor. You will
                also receive practical technical and soft skills training and
                guidance for research, and guidance of how to get into a
                research career as a computer scientist.
                <p>
                In this series of courses, you are expected to work with the
                same team throughout the three consecutive semesters.
                To continue in a project in subsequent courses, you are
                expected to demonstrate good performance through the project,
                including participating in regular meetings and lectures,
                responding to communications, making reasonable research
                progress and producing research artifacts (e.g.,
                software/hardware prototypes or proofs and analysis, technical
                reports/publication and/or presentation).

                To join one of the available <a href="prj_fa25.html"
                    target>projects</a>, you need to both be officially enrolled in Section
                B of one of CSE 302/303/402 and fill out this
                <a href="https://forms.gle/wsZyVaMUCmz36H4H6" target="_blank">project preference survey</a>.
                You do not have to be enrolled first to submit a project preference
                survey.  If the course is at capacity, you have not been
                enrolled and you are already assigned to a project, please
                submit email the course instructor and submit a force
                registration request. Please feel free to make a new submission
                of the survey if you need to update your information in a
                previous submission.


                <p>
                You should complete the survey as soon as possible because the
                project mentors of your preferred projects will need the
                information to make recommendations for assignment.  In any
                case, please make sure to complete the survey no later than the
                first day of the semester so we can complete your project
                assignment on time.
