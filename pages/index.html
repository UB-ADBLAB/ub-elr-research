                Welcome to UB CSE Experiential Learning and Research (EL/R).
                This course has two sections. Section A is focused on
                Experiential Learning and Research, Section B is focused on
                Experiential Research. This is the website for Section B.

                Welcome to the EL/R (Section B - Research). Through a series of
                up to three courses (CSE 302/303/402), you may select and
                contribute to a research project from a wide range of topics
                and areas and work closely with one of our faculty members who
                is an expert in those areas as your project mentor. You will
                also receive practical technical and soft skills training and
                guidance for research, and guidance of how to get into a
                research career as a computer scientist.
                <p>
                In this series of courses, you are expected to work with the
                same team throughout the three consecutive semesters.
                To continue in a project in subsequent courses, you are
                expected to demonstrate good performance through the project,
                including participating in regular meetings and lectures,
                responding to communications, making reasonable research
                progress and producing research artifacts (e.g.,
                software/hardware prototypes or proofs and analysis, technical
                reports/publication and/or presentation).

                <p> 
                To join one of the available <a href="prj_fa25.html"
                    target>projects</a>, you need to both be officially enrolled in Section
                B of one of CSE 302/303/402 and fill out this
                <a href="https://forms.gle/wsZyVaMUCmz36H4H6" target="_blank">project preference survey</a>.
                You do not have to be enrolled first to submit a project preference
                survey.  If the course is at capacity, you have not been
                enrolled and you are already assigned to a project, please
                submit email the course instructor and submit a force
                registration request. Please feel free to make a new submission
                of the survey if you need to update your information in a
                previous submission.


                <p>
                You should complete the survey as soon as possible because the
                project mentors of your preferred projects will need the
                information to make recommendations for assignment.  In any
                case, please make sure to complete the survey no later than the
                first day of the semester so we can complete your project
                assignment on time.

                <p>

                Academic integrity is a fundamental university value. Through
                the honest completion of academic work, students sustain the
                integrity of the university while facilitating the university's
                imperative for the transmission of knowledge and culture based
                upon the generation of new and innovative ideas. Please refer
                to the university Undergraduate Academic Integrity Policy

                for additional information. A violation in this class generally results in an F

                <p>
                As this is a special course series focusing on conducting
                computer science research, there are a few common dos and
                don'ts that you should pay attention to (more in full
                syllabi):

                <p>
                <li>You typically are allowed to reuse existing code from
                    almost anywhere with appropriate attribution (always
                    including a reference or a link to where the code or
                    library comes from, and retain a COPYRIGHT notice when it
                    is required), provided that there is no legal constraint or
                    other constraint due to the nature of your project that
                    would disallow so. However, existing code rarely works out
                    of the box for research projects and may result in future
                    problems (e.g., broken dependencies, etc.), so your project
                    mentor may have additional restrictions on what you may use
                    and may not use.
                </li>
                <li>If you find inspiration from an existing paper for your tasks, technical
                    documentation, always explicitly discuss it with others and possibly document it in
                    meeting notes or your technical reports.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should keep any materials in your ongoing project
                    confidential (e.g., source code, technical notes,
                    unpublished results, etc.), except when your project mentor
                    allows so, or to present during the lectures.
                </li>
                <li>When in doubt, it's always ok to first ask your project
                    team and your project mentor.
                </li>
