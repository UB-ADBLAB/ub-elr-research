DESC_START # A one or two sentence description of the project + logistics information
<p> In this study, we introduce the GloVoAD dataset, a meticulously curated,
multilingual, and multinational dataset that includes speech data from
individuals representing a range of cognitive statuses and demographics. With
samples drawn from varied age groups, languages, and tasks, GloVoAD aims to
enhance the generalizability of ADRD detection models to global populations.

Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) affect an estimated 50
million people worldwide, a number projected to triple by 2050 due to global
aging trends. Early detection is crucial for effective management, yet current
diagnostic approaches are often limited in scalability and inclusivity,
especially across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In this study, we
introduce the GloVoAD dataset, a meticulously curated, multilingual, and
multinational dataset that includes speech data from individuals representing
a range of cognitive statuses and demographics. With samples drawn from varied
age groups, languages, and tasks, GloVoAD aims to enhance the generalizability
of ADRD detection models to global populations. We developed a
language-agnostic model, relying exclusively on acoustic features that
circumvent the need for linguistic content analysis. This approach ensures
applicability across diverse linguistic backgrounds, making it suitable for
multilingual settings without requiring language-specific customization.
Finally, we establish a robust baseline through the selection of optimal
acoustic features and feature sets, combined with an exploration of ideal
audio segment lengths, to maximize model efficiency and detection accuracy.
This methodological refinement enhances both dataset utility and computational
efficiency, supporting scalable diagnostic applications, particularly within
telehealth frameworks. Collectively, our work with GloVoAD marks a significant
step toward democratizing ADRD diagnostics, providing accessible,
language-independent tools for diverse and underserved communities worldwide.
