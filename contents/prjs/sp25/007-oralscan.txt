OralScan addresses critical oral health disparities faced by individuals with
mobility, cognitive, and sensory disabilities, particularly in marginalized
communities. These populations often encounter significant barriers to care,
such as financial constraints, limited transportation, and a lack of knowledge
about preventive care. Systemic inequities further hinder access to consistent
oral healthcare in underserved areas.

Designed by a team experienced in AI, mobile health, and community engagement,
OralScan has potential to integrate seamlessly with Electronic Health Records
(EHR), allowing remote healthcare monitoring and reducing the need for
in-person visits. Features like voice commands, visual cues, and intuitive
navigation make the app accessible for users with various disabilities.

With its low-cost, automated, and user-friendly approach, OralScan empowers
individuals to proactively manage their oral health, ultimately reducing
healthcare disparities and providing equitable access to essential oral care
services for disabled and underserved communities.
