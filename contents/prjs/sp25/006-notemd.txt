We contribute to the field by having developed an end-to-end AI application
for instantaneous (<40 seconds) generation of high quality medical notes. It
requires minimum intervention from the physician's side. It records the
appointment audio, transcribes and diarizes it, generates the medical note
using a fine-tuned LLM, and displays it to the physician. Our app shows a
potential to save massive amounts of time, boost productivity, and prevent
burnouts.

Writing medical notes is an extremely time-consuming process for physicians,
often equating to the amount of time spent attending to patients. It is one of
the significant factors contributing to physician burnouts. Often physicians
do not think that it contributes to their decision making process, but they
regard it as a documentation chore. Despite being a significant problem it has
not received much attention from AI researchers. Only a handful of studies
have explored it to date.

We thoroughly compared our fine-tuned LLM to pre-trained proprietary LLMs,
e.g. GPT-4, Claude Opus, and open-source LLMs, e.g. Mixtral 8x7B. Mistral
8x22B. Our LLM outperforms the other best performing LLM by about 5% on
rouge-1, rouge-2, rouge-L, rouge-Lsum, BERTscore, and BLEURT. We then
conducted a Human Evaluation study with doctors, nurses, and medical students
as participants. Most of them showed an interest in trying out our app in
their practice and liked the easy-to-use and simple UI.
