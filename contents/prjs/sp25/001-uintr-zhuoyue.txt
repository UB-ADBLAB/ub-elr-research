TITLE=Fast Transaction Scheduling via Userspace Interrutps in Database Systems for HTAP
KEYWORDS=user interrupts; x86-64; hybrid tranasctional/analytical processing; database
MENTORS=<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~zzhao35" target="_blank">Prof. Zhuoyue Zhao</a>

DESC_START # A one or two sentence description of the project + logistics information
<p> In this project, we would like to design and build intelligent transaction
schedluing subsystems for database systems in Hybrid Transactional/Analytical
Processing use cases, leveraging a new hardware feature, user interrupts in
x86-64 ISA. The immediate goal of this semester is to design a character
device driver for enabling user interrupt features for userspace programs, and
demonstrate its usability and performance through integration in our existing
research prototype system.

<p>
The user interrupt feature introduced in x86-64 ISA in 2021 allows
inter-process communications without having to trap into kernels as in
traditional IPC methods such as signal or eventfd. This reduces the latency of
IPC down to close to 1-2 microsecond based on our benchmarking results.
We are exploring building a fast transaction scheduling subsystem based on uintr
and have promising preliminary results. However, this requires a specialized
kernel created by Intel. Now, we would also like to explore a second approach
discussed by the Intel developer by exposing the necessary kernel-space setup
functionalities through a character device driver, which could enable
additional uses of the feature that were not possible with the specialized
kernel. If it is successful, we will incorporate this new device driver into
the codebase of our prototype research DBMS to validate its performance and
enhance our next research publication submission.
