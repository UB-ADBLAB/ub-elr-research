DESC_START
Approximate Query Processing (**AQP**) can speed up SQL queries with a
trade-off in accuracy in relational database systems such as
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). This is often useful for interactive
data exploration and/or real-time data analysis workloads in real-world data
intensive applications. This project aims to design
a toolkit for providing AQP functionalities in PostgreSQL as a
pluggable extension,
[pgAQP](). In this
project, you will work closely with other graduate students and gain
hands-on experience with designing, prototyping and implementing new
features or performance tuning for large codebases.
