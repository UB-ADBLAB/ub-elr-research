Our project seeks to address these challenges by developing VocalLens, an
innovative, web-based, AI-driven mHealth tool for early Specific Language
Impairment (SLI) screening. The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to
create an accurate, cost- effective, and accessible SLI screening solution
that reduces the burden on families and healthcare systems, while improving
language outcomes and the overall quality of life for children with SLI.

In the United States, Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is a prevalent
neurodevelopmental disorder affecting approximately 2 million children,
leading to significant long-term challenges in language acquisition, social
interactions, and academic achievement. Current methods for diagnosing SLI are
resource-intensive, costly, and often inaccessible, particularly for families
in rural and low-income areas. Our project seeks to address these challenges
by developing VocalLens, an innovative, web-based, AI-driven mHealth tool for
early SLI screening. VocalLens leverages advanced AI and Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) technologies to analyze children's speech across multiple
linguistic levels—phoneme, syllable, word, and pause patterns—providing richer
linguistic assessments and automated, cost-effective self-assessment in
naturalistic settings such as homes and schools. By capturing and providing
detailed objective biomarkers, VocalLens significantly enhances the accuracy
and efficiency of SLI diagnosis. Designed with a user-friendly interface,
VocalLens includes clear instructions, demos, and detailed explanations,
making it accessible to parents and teachers without requiring extensive
domain knowledge. The system will be refined through iterative usability
testing with stakeholders to ensure it remains intuitive, user-friendly, and
meets the diverse needs of its users. Additionally, ecological usability tests
will further optimize the system’s interface, enhancing its accessibility and
ease of use. The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to create an accurate,
cost- effective, and accessible SLI screening solution that reduces the burden
on families and healthcare systems, while improving language outcomes and the
overall quality of life for children with SLI.
