TITLE=MobiPerf: A Truly Mobile Blood Perfusion System for Diabetic Foot Care
KEYWORDS=hyperspectral reconstruction; diabetic foot ulcers; deep learning
MENTORS=<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~wenyaoxu" target="_blank">Prof. Wenyao Xu</a>

MobiPerf is a novel system which leverages hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR)
for diabetic foot wound care on mobile devices thrugh systematic inprovments
to the whole HSR sensing scheme. Forgoing the typical way of doing HSR in
smart health we instead use modern deep learning HSR technology, which we pair
with a new calibration-free skin composition estimation method and a new and
robust oxygenation feature.

In the United States around 1.6 million individuals deal with diebetic foot
ulcers (DFU). DFU is a lethal condition with around a 20% 5-year mortality
rate in addition to significantly affecting the mobilibity and quality of life
of those who have it.  DFU is highly related to the wound blood perfusion
which is how sucessfully oxygenated blood is delivered to all parts of the
wound's tissue. Given the challenges associated with getting around with a DFU
there has been a recent focus on developing tools to chartarize ulcers using
unmodified mobile devices. Existing methods for mobile wound analysis
typically use surrogate markers such as size and discoloration which they
track over time. In mobile health there is an emerging set of applications for
a technology called hyperspectral reconstruction which enables smartphone
cameras to be used to image the composition of various tissues, this has been
used before to image blood perfusion as well. 

MobiPerf is a novel system which leverages hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR)
for diabetic foot wound care on mobile devices thrugh systematic inprovments
to the whole HSR sensing scheme. Forgoing the typical way of doing HSR in
smart health we instead use modern deep learning HSR technology, which we pair
with a new calibration-free skin composition estimation method and a new and
robust oxygenation feature. Overall yielding a system that can reasonably be
deployed and used on mobile devices without the burdens typically associated
with hospital based devices.  We also use our system to obtain remote PPG
signals which supplements the perfusion information with highly related
cardiac information. We test our system against a true hyperspectral camera, a
dataset of videos intended for camera PPG estimation, and a public dataset of
diabetic foot ulcer images.
