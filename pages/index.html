                If yes, this is the right place!  Welcome to the EL/R
                (Research) program at the Department of Computer Science and
                Engineering of University at Buffalo. Through a series of up to
                three courses (CSE 302/303/402), you may select and contribute
                to a research project from a wide range of topics and areas and
                work closely with one of our faculty members who is an expert
                in those areas as your project mentor.  You will also receive practical technical and
                soft skills training and guidance for research, and guidance of
                how to get into a research career as a computer scientist.

                <p>
                For CS major first enrolled in or after Fall 2023, CSE 302/303
                can count towards your two speciailization requirements, and
                CSE 402 counts towards your capstone requirement. For students enrolled before that,
                CSE 302/302/402 count towards your CSE 300/400 electives.

                <h3>Enrollment Process</h3>
                <p> 
                During the open enrollment period, faculty members will post a
                number of research projects with
                vacancies. To get enrolled in this course, you will need to

                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Identify one to three projects you are interested in.
                        The available projects for Spring 2025 are listed <a
                            href="prj_sp25.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    <li> Fill out this questionnaire <a href="">form</a> to
                        answer a few questions about yourself (motivation,
                        technical strengths, etc.), and the 1 - 3 projects
                        you'd like to apply to.

                    <li> Expect one or more emails from the project mentor (the
                        faculty member who supervises the selected project)
                        for interview and/or approval into the project.

                    <li> If you receive approval from the project mentor, you
                        may submit a force registration into one of CSE
                        302/303/402. Usually, if this is the first time you're
                        in the program, you should enroll in CSE 302. If you
                        have passed CSE 302, you should enroll in CSE 303. If
                        you have passed both, you should enroll in CSE 402.

                    <li> Substantially contribute to project through literature
                        survey, research hypothesis and prototype design and/or
                        experimentation and validation.
                    <li> Actively interact with project mentor and teammates to
                        identify challenges, set goals and resolve issues;
                    <li> Participate in basic research training through
                        once-per-week lectures, where topics include research
                        methodologies, soft and technical skill training (e.g.,
                        academic writing and oral presentation), technical
                        skill training (e.g., basic tools for producing
                        technical documents, programming, system
                        administration, and visualuzation).
                    <li> Demonstrating research outcome through oral
                        presentation and written reports.
                </ul>



                <p>
                You are expected to work with the same team throughout the
                entire series of three courses in three consecutive semeseters.
                To continue in a project in subsequent courses, you need to
                demonstrate good performance through the project, including
                participating in regular meetings and lectures, responding to
                communiations (IM tools/email), making reasonable research
                progress and producing research artifacts (software/technical
                reports/presentation). Students with low performance (as
                determined by the final grade), may not be able to obtain
                approval for registration request in the subsequent semester.
